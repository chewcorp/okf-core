ORIENTATION_GUIDE = """# OKF Bundle Agent & Developer Orientation

Welcome! This guide provides the core information needed for developers and automated agents to quickly onboard and integrate with an Open Knowledge Format (OKF) bundle.

## 1. What is an OKF Bundle?
An OKF bundle is a structured folder containing knowledge assets. At a minimum, it consists of:
- **Concept Documents**: Markdown files containing YAML frontmatter defining their metadata (specifically the `type` field).
- **Configuration**: An optional `okf-core.toml` file defining defaults and named bundles.

## 2. Configuration (`okf-core.toml`)
A bundle is configured using an optional `okf-core.toml` file at the root. Here is an example of common configuration options (the full reference is in README.md):
```toml
[defaults]
# Relative path to the folder containing concept markdown files (default: ".")
bundle_root = "docs"
# Glob patterns to include/exclude as concepts
include = ["**/*.md"]
exclude = []
# Files ignored as concepts (default: ["index.md", "log.md"])
reserved_filenames = ["index.md", "log.md"]
# Strategy to generate concept IDs (default: "relative-path")
concept_path_strategy = "relative-path"
# Metadata file used for directory-level attributes
directory_metadata_file = "_directory.yml"

[bundles.docs]
# Named bundle inherits/overrides [defaults]
bundle_root = "docs"
# Path to cache directory (bundle-level only; required for search and unlinked mentions)
okf_cache_dir = ".okf-cache"
# Frontmatter field for stable concept ID (bundle-level only)
stable_id_field = "id"
# Optional validation profile name
profile = "standard"
```

## 3. Core Integration Commands
To interact with or integrate a bundle, start with these essential commands:

- **List Concepts**: Discover all addressable concepts in the bundle.
  ```sh
  okf list-concepts
  ```
- **Validate**: Check the bundle for spec conformance and profile rules, every directory's committed `index.md` for drift against its own content, and every existing `log.md` for OKF v0.2 §9 date headings (ISO 8601 `YYYY-MM-DD`, newest first).
  ```sh
  okf validate
  ```
- **Scan**: Retrieve a complete JSON manifest of all concepts and identified problems.
  ```sh
  okf scan
  ```

## 4. Progressive Discovery
To discover more advanced capabilities, commands, and options:
- **CLI Options & Help**: Run `okf --help` to list all subcommands. For detailed options on any specific command, run:
  ```sh
  okf <command> --help
  ```
- **Detailed Reference**: Check the bundle's `README.md` for full command specifications and Python library APIs (e.g. `plan_markdown_link_rewrite`, `plan_markdown_section_patch`, `plan_markdown_section_append`, `move_concept`, `plan_graph_repair`, `apply_link_suggestions`, `normalize_bundle_graph`, `acquire_normalized_graph`, `analyze_normalized_graph`, `render_graph_report`, `render_graph_json`, `write_bundle_graph_artifacts`, `run_graph_report`, `render_graph_summary`, `log_concept_move`, `log_append`, `source_upsert`, `stamp_generated`, `stamp_verified`, `stamp_status`, `stamp_stale_after`).
- **Graph reports**: `okf graph-report [--bundle NAME]... [--output DIR] [--json]` writes generated diagnostics (not wiki notes) under `wiki-graph-out/` by default (`SUMMARY.md`, `<slug>/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graph.json`). See `okf graph-report --help` and the README `okf graph-report` section for flags and scope.
- **Link Maintenance**: Run `okf unlinked-mentions --help` to discover options for finding concept-title mentions that are not yet linked, and for writing selected suggestions back as Markdown links with `--apply`.
- **Cache Maintenance**: If a command reports `cache_problems`, or `okf search` exits 2 asking for it, run `okf migrate-db --help` to see how to bring an `okf-cache.db` written by an older `okf-core` to the current schema version. Documents are never touched.
- **Local Reading**: `okf serve` runs a read-only localhost HTTP server for the bundle (default http://127.0.0.1:8080/), exposing only permitted Markdown and directory `index.md` files — never `fleeting`, dot-segments, cache, or config files. Opening the URL in a browser renders the bundle (frontmatter, links, navigation, Mermaid) through a packaged client-side adapter; other clients get raw files. See `okf serve --help`.
- **Orientation Guide**: Run `okf orient` to print this onboarding guide.
