# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records the decisions that shape `okf-core`'s architecture —
the kind of choice that is expensive to re-litigate from scratch each time it
resurfaces in a new issue. It exists because the instruction set alone
(`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/agents/*.md`) enforces *how* to write code, but had no
place to record *why* a direction was chosen over its alternatives, or what
would have to change for that choice to be revisited. See
`[replan-analysis] §4` for the analysis that motivated this directory.

Every agent role planning or reviewing design/architecture work must read
this index and the ADRs it lists before starting. See `AGENTS.md`'s
"Decision Records" section and `.claude/agents/milestone-planner.md`.

## Format

Each ADR is a Markdown file named `NNNN-short-slug.md`, numbered sequentially.
An ADR has these sections:

- **Status** — one of `PROPOSED`, `ACCEPTED`, or `SUPERSEDED` (with a pointer
  to the ADR that supersedes it). A `PROPOSED` decision is not yet binding on
  implementation work; treat it as a documented direction under discussion,
  not a rule to enforce.
- **Context** — the problem, and the evidence available at decision time
  (spikes, codebase analysis, prior ADRs).
- **Decision** — the actual choice, stated concretely enough that an
  implementor doesn't have to re-derive it.
- **Alternatives rejected** — what else was considered and why it lost. A
  decision without a rejected alternative usually means the comparison never
  happened.
- **Revisit trigger** — the concrete condition that would justify reopening
  this decision. Not "if we feel like it later" — a checkable event or
  threshold.

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0001](0001-supersede-round-trip-refactor-descope.md) | Supersede the round-trip refactor descope | ACCEPTED |
| [0002](0002-canonical-serialization-form.md) | Canonical serialization form | ACCEPTED (framework + YAML + Markdown) |
| [0003](0003-attribution-footnote-label-charset.md) | Attribution footnote label charset | ACCEPTED |
| [0004](0004-cache-schema-versioning.md) | Cache schema versioning | ACCEPTED |
| [0005](0005-local-browser-renderer.md) | Local browser renderer is a thin client-side adapter | ACCEPTED |

## Registered spike-era decisions

These predate this directory and are adopted into it retroactively. They are
left in place under `docs/spikes/` (their evidence stands and existing
issue/PR links reference their current paths) but now carry a pointer banner
into the ADR that governs their current adoption status:

- `docs/spikes/148-round-trip-refactor-descope.md` — superseded by
  [ADR-0001](0001-supersede-round-trip-refactor-descope.md).
- `docs/spikes/149-markdown-round-trip.md` — evidence re-verified and
  adopted by [ADR-0002](0002-canonical-serialization-form.md) (Markdown
  side, ACCEPTED via issue #198).
- `docs/spikes/issue-117-yaml-frontmatter-editing.md` — evidence adopted by
  [ADR-0002](0002-canonical-serialization-form.md) (YAML side, ACCEPTED).
- `docs/spikes/177-postmortem-delivery-loop-design.md` — design-only spike,
  not superseded; no ADR currently governs it.

## Failure ledger

`failure-ledger.md` in this directory is a separate append-only log (not an
ADR) of `request_changes` review rounds, used to detect recurring bug
categories across issues. See that file for its format and the three-strikes
rule.

## Citing external documents

Citations of the `docs/proposals/v0.5.0-replan/` document family — the
source family registered in `references.md` — in `docs/decisions/` and the
instruction files that cite the same sources use an inline bracket slug
convention (never a bare path to that family, aside from the single
sanctioned exception `references.md` records). See `references.md` in this
directory for the citation rules and the canonical registry of slugs. This
convention does not govern same-repo file pointers to other paths, such as
the `docs/spikes/*.md` references in "Registered spike-era decisions" above,
which are cited by ordinary bare path.
